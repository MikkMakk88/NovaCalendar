# NovaCalendar

My school uses an annoying and ancient web app for viewing timetables, hopefully this project will mean I never have to use it again.

This project will gather pdfs from the website using selenium.
Those pdfs will then be parsed for the individual lesson data.
I will then try to add this data automatically to my calendar.
